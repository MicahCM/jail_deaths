"Note: Data may have been revised from previously published statistics. Mortality rates are per 100,000 inmates held in the custody of local jails. Mortality rates for 2001–2019 are based on the annual number of deaths and the average daily population (ADP). In 2000, the ADP was estimated by taking the average of January 1 and December 31 inmate population counts. See Methodology. See table 7 for rates.",,,
