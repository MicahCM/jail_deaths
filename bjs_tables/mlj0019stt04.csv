"Note: Rates exclude persons age 17 or younger and federal prisoners. U.S. general population mortality rate is per 100,000 adult U.S. residents and is based on death certificates from all U.S. residents in 2019, including incarcerated persons. The jail mortality rate is per 100,000 inmates held in the custody of local jails and is based on the annual number of deaths and average daily population.",,,,,
! Interpret with caution. Estimate is based on 10 or fewer cases. See Interpreting rates among small populations in Methodology.,,,,,
"a/The sex, race or ethnicity, and age composition of the U.S. resident population differs from that of local jail inmates. To allow for direct comparisons of mortality rates, BJS adjusted the U.S. resident population to resemble the sex, race or ethnicity, and age distribution of the local jail population.",,,,,
b/Rates may differ from those presented elsewhere in this report due to the removal of local jail inmates age 17 or younger from both the numerator (deaths) and denominator (local jail population) and the exclusion of deaths for which cause of death was unknown or missing. These changes were made solely to table 4 and figure 3 to make the mortality rates comparable to those in the U.S. resident population.,,,,,
c/Includes persons who died of illness and were identified as HIV-positive or having AIDS at the time of death.,,,,,
"d/Includes other specified illnesses (such as cerebrovascular disease, influenza, and other nonleading natural causes of death) and unspecified illnesses.",,,,,
"e/Excludes causes of death that are unlikely to occur in a jail setting, including motor vehicle accidents; homicides due to explosives or firearms not related to law enforcement, motor vehicle assault, or neglect; and firearm discharges not related to law enforcement. ",,,,,
"f/Includes homicides committed by other inmates, incidental to the use of force by staff, and resulting from assaults sustained prior to incarceration.",,,,,
