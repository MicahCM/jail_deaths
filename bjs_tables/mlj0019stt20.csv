"Note: Data may have been revised from previously published statistics. Mortality rates are per 100,000 inmates held in the custody of local jails. Mortality rates for 2001–2019 are based on the annual number of deaths and the average daily population (ADP). In 2000, the ADP was estimated by taking the average of January 1 and December 31 inmate population counts. Mortality rates are not adjusted for demographic differences among states. Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont each operate a combined prison and jail system. For data on these states, see Mortality in State and Federal Prisons, 2001–2019 – Statistical Tables (NCJ 300953, BJS, December 2021). See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
! Interpret with caution. Estimate is based on 10 or fewer cases. See Interpreting rates among small populations in Methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*Prisons and jails form one integrated system. Counts include only deaths in 15 locally operated jails and exclude deaths in state-operated prisons and jails.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
