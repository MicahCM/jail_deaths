This document has the code corresponding to [this investigative
memorandum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwExEtuXhfnc-PM-9RGYx75Xs753CiVJZTHKCIE7_5E/edit#heading=h.1895lafuquc4)
on the national jail crisis. Please refer to the memo for background and
interpretation of results.

Note: When jail deaths or average daily populations were not recorded in
the data set, I replaced the missing value with zero. This will lead to
an under count of jail deaths and an undercount of average daily
population. While there are few missing values, if you’re interested in
digging deeper into jails with few incidence of death, it’s important to
double-check the death incidence were in fact reported.

# 1. Total \# of jail deaths in the country since \_\_\_\_

### Table 2d: Jail deaths by jail population in 2019

This table represents the 20 jails with the highest rate of jail death
in 2019. This is calculated by dividing the total deaths by the average
daily population. This is to identify small and large jails with high
rates of death.

For example, in this comparison a jail with 1 death and an average daily
population of 1000 will have the same death rate as a jail with 10
deaths and an average daily population of 10,000.
